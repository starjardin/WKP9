## Readme update

1. Structure of my code.
  - Firstly, I created the html where I'll locate the film data.
  - Secondly, I created a function that fetches the data from the sever and a function that takes that data into a collections of objects, and create a function to generate the html.

1. I had more time, I was about to work if I could delete the films from my page, I would add a button that can add the score rate when you click the button

1. I did, learn something, such as sort function is a bit more clearer now, async, awaits is a still blury but more clearer than before.

1.The most challenging part was, to take the data from the server but after a long try, something starts working.

1. If I had to say a new explanation about a specific topic, the first thing I would like you to go is async and await function that returns data.
